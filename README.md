#Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning models.  
The dataset used is the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**, which contains customer demographics, account information, and service usage details.  

##  Project Workflow

1. Data Loading & Cleaning
   - Handled missing values and irrelevant features.
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical encodings.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualized customer distribution across gender, tenure, services, and churn status.
   - Explored correlations between features.

3. Feature Engineering
   - Encoded categorical columns.
   - Normalized numerical features.

4. Model Building
   - Applied machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Compared model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Evaluation & Insights
   - Identified key factors contributing to customer churn.
   - Built a model capable of predicting customers likely to leave.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**

##Results

- Built classification models to predict churn with competitive accuracy.
- Highlighted important customer behaviors and services linked with churn.
- Provided insights that businesses can use to improve retention strategies.

## Future Work

- Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
- Deploying the model using **Flask/Streamlit** for real-time prediction.
- Adding SHAP/LIME for explainable AI.
